# 2.5.2 - Read Full Book Record

Note: You could implement the functions with complex queries or use existing read functions
to compose a JSON result from multiple function calls. The pseudocode will be written with the
latter option.

Note: Pseudocode and variable/function names are only for guidance. The only things that are a must 
are the inputs and outputs of the functions.

JSON Schema that all resulting functions that return the whole record must have:
Note: Sample data is included (max possible authors and genres included)
```JSON
{"ISBN": "user_provided_isbn",
 "title": "SomeBook",
 "publish_date": "2026",
 "publisher_id": "3",
 "summary": "asdfdasadfsdfsafds",
 "tag_id": "4",
 "chapters": "23",
 "chapters_completed": "3",
 "cover_image_bytes": "",
 "AuthorID_1": "1",
 "Author_First_Name_1": "John",
 "Author_Last_Name_1": "Doe",
 "AuthorID_2": "4",
 "Author_First_Name_2": "Jane",
 "Author_Last_Name_3": "Doe",
 "Publisher_Name": "SomePublisher",
 "Owned": "yes",
 "Favorite": "yes",
 "Completed": "no",
 "Currently_Reading": "yes",
 "PersonalOrAcademic": "personal",
 "GenreID_1": "1",
 "Genre_1": "fiction",
 "GenreID_2": "3",
 "Genre_2": "fantasy",
 "GenreID_3": "6",
 "Genre_3": "humor",
 "GenreID_4": "4",
 "Genre_4": "drama"}
```

These functions will need to either use existing, reworked, or new query functions to construct.
The following functions are needed:
- read_isbn_by_title(title) -> JSON
  - Return JSON Schema:
    ````JSON
    {"ISBN":  ["1234567890123", "1231231231231"]}
    ````

### 2.5.2.2 - Read Book Record(s) Based on Title (i.e. return all entries).

````
read_full_book_by_title(title): -> JSON
    # First block searchs with only words like 'the'
    # We can work on the BLOCK_LIST later
    BLOCK_LIST = ['the', 'a', 'be', 'that']
    IF title.lower().strip() in BLOCK_LIST:
        Decline search
    
    # Query Book table for matches
    isbn_results = read_isbn_by_title(title) -> JSON

    FOR result in isbn_results: 
        json_result.update(read_book_record_by_isbn(result))
    return all results as JSON to caller
````
